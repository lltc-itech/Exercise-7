# Exercise 7 - Conditionals and Loops

For this assignment, we're going to practice using conditionals and loops. For each of these problems, you'll be tasked with a simple problem for which a conditional or a loop or both are required to complete the program. Each problem has a start file that includes some text that introduces the web page and then a `<script>` element in which to write some code.

## 1 - Find the larger of two numbers.

In `larger.html`, write a JS program which takes two numbers from the user as input and outputs to the page the larger of the two numbers. Don't forget to pay attention to data types!

## 2 - Find the largest of an arbitrary set of numbers

In `largest.html`, write a JS program which will take an arbitrary list of numbers and output the largest one the user enters.

## 3 - Parity Redux!

In `parity.html`, write a JS program which outputs the parity of entered integer using a conditional instead of a ternary operator.

## 4 - Fizz Buzz

This is a classic programming problem that everyone has to do eventually. In `fizzbuzz.html`, you'll write a program that outputs the first 100 integers with the following conditions:

* If the number is divisible by 3, it should instead print the word "Fizz".
* If the number is divisible by 5, it should print the word "Buzz".
* If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, it should print "FizzBuzz".
* If the number is divisible by neither, it should just print the number.

You'll need to initialize a few variables, including a counter and use a while loop.
